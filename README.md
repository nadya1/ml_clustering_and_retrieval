## Course Applications
  
 - Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.
 - Identify various similarity metrics for text data.
 - Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.
 - Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.
 - Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
 - Cluster documents by topic using k-means.
 - Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.
 - Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.
 - Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).
 - Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
 - Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.
 - Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives
